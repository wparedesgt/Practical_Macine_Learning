Pregunta 2
Suppose we build a prediction algorithm on a data set and it is 100% accurate on that data set. Why might the algorithm not work well if we collect a new data set?
  
  1 punto

We have too few predictors to get good out of sample accuracy.


Our algorithm may be overfitting the training data, predicting both the signal and the noise.


We may be using bad variables that don't explain the outcome.v


We have used neural networks which has notoriously bad performance.

Pregunta 3
What are typical sizes for the training and test sets?

1 punto

90% training set, 10% test set


100% training set, 0% test set.


20% training set, 80% test set.


60% in the training set, 40% in the testing set.

Root mean squared error


R^2


Correlation

Pregunta 5
Suppose that we have created a machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a link will be clicked with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. The rate the link is clicked is 1/1000 of visits to a website. If we predict the link will be clicked on a specific visit, what is the probability it will actually be clicked?
